# Winning Strategy - La Nuit de l'Info 2025

## Critical Reminder

> **Judges have ~3 MINUTES per project. Make every second count!**

## Winning Formula

### DO (What Makes Winners)

| Priority | Action | Why It Wins |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Immediate visual impact** | First impression in 5 seconds |
| 2 | **ONE perfect WOW feature** | Memorable > Complete |
| 3 | **Tell a story** | Emotion > Information |
| 4 | **Show, don't tell** | Demo > Documentation |
| 5 | **Use the Asterix metaphor** | On-theme = On-message |
| 6 | **Working demo** | Broken = Disqualified |

### DON'T (Common Failures)

| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| Boring "corporate" site | Forgettable in 30 seconds |
| 10 mediocre features | Jack of all trades, master of none |
| List facts | Judges won't read them |
| Walls of text | TL;DR = skipped |
| Ignore the given theme | Off-topic = lower score |
| "It will work soon" | Broken promises = zero points |

## The 6 Key Messages

Your site MUST communicate these clearly:

1. **The crisis is real and urgent**
   - October 2025 deadline
   - 240 million PCs to discard worldwide
   - 68% of French gov PCs on Windows 10

2. **A solution EXISTS**
   - Linux + open source = free + often better
   - Works on old hardware
   - Real alternative, not just theory

3. **Schools are already doing this**
   - NIRD has proven results
   - 132 computers reconditioned
   - 11 schools benefited

4. **It's more than money**
   - Freedom from vendor lock-in
   - Data sovereignty
   - Environmental sustainability

5. **Anyone can start**
   - PrimTux works with 2GB RAM, 30GB SSD
   - €30 SSD transforms old PC
   - Step-by-step guides exist

6. **Join a community**
   - You're not alone
   - The "village" welcomes newcomers
   - Support network available

## WOW Feature Ideas (Pick ONE!)

### Option A: Interactive Choice Simulator
User chooses school's path, sees real-time cost/benefit comparison:
- "Upgrade to Windows 11" → €300-800/PC, recurring costs
- "Switch to Linux" → €0, extended hardware life
- "Do Nothing" → Security risks, eventual crisis

### Option B: "Refurbish & Liberate" Mini-Game
1. Old PC appears on screen
2. User "diagnoses" issues
3. Drag Linux USB to PC
4. Watch it boot into Linux
5. Counter shows "PCs saved from landfill"

### Option C: Live Carbon Calculator
- Compare CO2 footprint: new PC vs refurbished
- Show "trees saved" equivalent
- Gamified: "Your school saved X kg CO2"

### Option D: Village Map Interactive
- Explore the Gaulish village
- Each hut = one NIRD pillar
- Click to learn, animations reveal content
- Collect "knowledge potions"

## Judge Psychology

## Presentation Tips

### The 3-Minute Pitch
1. **0:00-0:30** - Hook with the problem (crisis)
2. **0:30-1:30** - Demo the main feature (WOW)
3. **1:30-2:30** - Show the story flow (scrollytelling)
4. **2:30-3:00** - Call-to-action & summary

### If Asked Questions
- "Why this approach?" → Asterix metaphor makes complex issue accessible
- "What's the tech stack?" → Next.js 16, React 19, Framer Motion
- "Is it realistic?" → Yes, NIRD has real success stories
